# Description

This example project shows how to integrate a React application inside a Vert.x application.

It is a multi-project build with one project for the Vert.x application and one project for the React one.

It builds the React application thanks to the `react-script` package. The React project was generated by `create-react-app`.

It bundles the React application as a jar in the `webroot` subdirectory that Vert.x serves as static resources (as configured in the `MainVerticle`).

The default React output directory (`build`) was changed to `build/webapp/webroot` and the `build/webapp`
directory was added to the Java resources.

A selenium based test ensures that the React application is served by Vert.x as expected.

It uses the globally installed Node.js. It also uses yarn.

# Build

```

# Serve
